Throughout this workshop, you'll gain hands-on experience in:

- Automating workflows to streamline your development process.
- Running tests to ensure code quality and reliability.
- Deploying applications efficiently to various environments.
- Leveraging GitHub Actions to integrate with third-party services and tools.

The workshop is structured around a series of labs, exercises, and real-world example workflows. Each lab is crafted to incrementally build your knowledge and skills, making it accessible whether you're a beginner exploring automation for the first time or an experienced developer looking to optimize and scale your CI/CD pipelines.
